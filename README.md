# MedNet Enterprise Lab

> **Enterprise Healthcare IT Infrastructure & Security Operations Home Lab**
> A fully integrated, multi-service enterprise environment simulating the infrastructure of a mid-size healthcare organization. Built to demonstrate real-world IT and security operations skills across networking, systems administration, monitoring, SIEM, automation, and endpoint management.

---

## Overview

MedNet Enterprise Lab is a virtualized enterprise environment built around a simulated healthcare organization operating under the domain **mednet.lab**. The lab is designed to reflect the complexity and security requirements of a real healthcare IT environment — not a basic home lab — with integrated services that communicate with and depend on one another the same way production infrastructure does.

The project covers the full stack of enterprise IT operations: identity and access management, file services, IT service management, infrastructure monitoring, security event management, endpoint administration, and automation. Every component is documented with the same standards expected in a professional environment.

This lab serves as the capstone portfolio project supporting a career transition into NOC analyst and network engineer roles, with a focus on healthcare IT environments where uptime, access control, and compliance are critical.

## Architecture

The environment is built around Active Directory as the central identity provider. All services authenticate against the domain, and access to resources is governed by AD groups and GPOs organized around a realistic hospital organizational structure.

Service integrations:
- Zabbix triggers automatic osTicket tickets on threshold alerts
- Wazuh agents deployed on all domain-joined endpoints
- osTicket authenticates users via LDAPS against Active Directory
- File server permissions enforced through AD security groups
- Ansible and PowerShell automation handles AD user onboarding/offboarding

## Lab Design Principles

**Healthcare context is intentional.** The OU structure, security groups, GPOs, and workflows are modeled after a realistic hospital IT environment. This means strict access control, separation of duties between clinical and administrative staff, and security policies that reflect HIPAA-aligned thinking.

**Integration over isolation.** Every service is connected to at least one other. Zabbix feeds into osTicket. Wazuh watches the endpoints. AD governs access everywhere. The goal is to demonstrate that these tools work as a system, not just as individual installs.

**Security is layered.** The environment includes network-level monitoring (Zabbix), host-based intrusion detection (Wazuh), endpoint protection (Windows Defender ingested by Wazuh), and identity-enforced access control (Active Directory). This mirrors a real defense-in-depth approach.

**Documentation reflects real operations.** Docs are written as they would be in a professional environment — focused on design decisions, configurations, and validation rather than step-by-step tutorials.
